# Oasis-Internship
Welcome to my internship project repository!

This repository showcases my work during my internship, focusing on projects that demonstrate my skills in web development, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project is a reflection of my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly web interfaces, with a strong emphasis on responsive design to ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.

Feel free to explore the projects and their code to get an insight into my coding style, problem-solving approach, and attention to detail. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting!
